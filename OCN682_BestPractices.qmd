## Geometry & Mapping

Use the most appropriate geometry (e.g., scatterplot for correlation, boxplot for distribution).

Use misleading or inappropriate geometry (e.g., pie charts for high-cardinality data, stacked bars for individual points).

Graphical Integrity (Tufte); Principle of Appropriateness (Wilke)

## Color

Use perceptually uniform, color-blind-friendly palettes (e.g., Viridis, ColorBrewer Set 1). Use color to encode meaning (semantic mapping).

Use high-contrast, non-semantic, or aggressive colors (e.g., rainbow palette, neon colors, red/green for non-binary data).

Color as a Signal (Healy); Perceptual Accuracy (Wilke)

## Data-Ink Ratio

Maximize the data-ink ratio: every visual element should convey data. Use minimalist themes (e.g., theme_minimal).

Introduce excessive chart junk: heavy borders, dark/busy backgrounds, unnecessary 3D effects, and ornate design elements.

Maximizing the Data-Ink Ratio (Tufte); Clarity and Efficiency (Wilke)

## Typography & Text

Use legible, concise, and consistent text. Set a clear, informative title and precise axis labels.

Use conflicting fonts, extremely small or oversized text, verbose titles, and distracting colors for labels.

Text and Typography (Healy); Legibility and Annotation (Wilke)

## Axis/Scale

Always start quantitative axes at zero (especially for bar charts). Use consistent scales when comparing across facets.

## Faceting/Grouping

Group elements closely for easy comparison. Use facets sparingly and ensure scale consistency across panels.
