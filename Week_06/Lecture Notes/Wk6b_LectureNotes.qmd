# Introduction

Today we are learning about how to work with figures

## Load the libraries

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

#Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(kableExtra)
```

# Make a plot
```{r}
#| warning: false
#| out-width: "70%"
#| fig-align: "center"
#| label: fig-penguin
#| fig-cap: "This is a figure showing bill length by bill depth"

penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species))+
  geom_point()
```

When you look @fig-penguin we can see there is a positive relationship between bill length and bill depth.

penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(billmean = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  kbl() %>% # make it a kable table
```

@tbl-penguin has information on the mean bill length by species
